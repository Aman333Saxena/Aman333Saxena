### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I have keen interest in Competitive Programming & Web Development. I am fond of playing Cricket & solving Big-O complexities. When I'm not glued to a computer screen, I'm likely exploring the mighty Universe. 

Here is what I am :point_right: [Aman Saxena](https://aman333saxena.github.io/Portfolio/) :point_left: what I do!

For any query or a fruitful discussion, you may connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amansaxena333/). 
Would love to share & learn new things!
